# Amazon Vine Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to investigate reviews left on Amazon products by members of Vine; a program in which individuals are supplied with products and paid to review them for Amazon.
The client Jennifer was interested in the integrity of the reviews made by members of the Vine program and wanted to compare them to reviews left by customers who are not part of the Vine program.
The study will seek extract data on amazon reviews, and reliably analyze this data to measure bias found by reviewers in the Vine program.

## Results
Our analysis was conducted on reviews left in the videogame section of Amazons products.
Before analysis was performed it was important to make sure our data was reliable. 
The data was filtered to only include reviews with at least 20 votes.
Additionally, only reviews found helpful were counted (at least 50% of votes were "helpful).
The analysis answered the questions of:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? 
Our data included 64,008 reviews from non-Vine members and 102 from Vine members.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 20,282 5 star reviews for non-Vine, and 48 5-star reviews for 5 members.

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
For Vine members there was 47.1% rate of 5-star reviews and 31.7% of reviews were 5-star for non-Vine members.

## Summary
Based on the findings above, it appears that the Vine program does in fact lead to a bias toward 5-star reviews. 
There was a significantly higher rate of 5-star reviews left through the Vine program.
This analysis only investigated the rate of 5-star reviews, this is just one of the ways review bias could be discovered.
Additional analysis could be used on all reviews from 1 to 5 and investigate the mean as well as create visualizations of all reviews to further investigate the nature of this bias.
